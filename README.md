# Genetic Toggle Switch with Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)

# Overview
This project models a genetic toggle switch, a bistable system influenced by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The simulation incorporates Gaussian and LÃ©vy noise, and a FCNN + Transformer model is used to estimate key parameters and predict system behavior.

 # System Dynamics
The genetic toggle switch consists of two mutually repressing genes, governed by nonlinear differential equations. The system is defined by:

# Gene Expression: Modeled using Hill functions and degradation rates.
Stochastic Effects: Incorporates Gaussian and LÃ©vy noise to simulate real-world randomness.
Key Parameters: Includes production/degradation rates, Hill coefficient, and additional regulatory factors.
# Dataset
The dataset is stored in HDF5 format and contains:

U_data: Time-series data for protein U concentration.
V_data: Time-series data for protein V concentration.
Noise Contributions: Gaussian and LÃ©vy noise effects.
Switch Parameters: Recorded values of a, b, r, k, e per sample.
